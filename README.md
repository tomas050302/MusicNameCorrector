> The project is based in the idea that big a folder with a lot of files should have some normalization in the file naming. This way, this script will help you have all the names sanitized with capitalization and '-' separation.

## Install

```sh
yarn
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn start
```

## Example

All the names should follow this pattern:

`Artist - Music Name feat. Other Artist`

## Technologies

For this implementation I'm using NodeJS and the FS library in the backend along with ReactJS to provide the user interface for the web browser.
