# Project

## Description

The project is based in the idea that big a folder with a lot of files should have some normalization in the file naming. This way, this script will help you have all the names sanitized with capitalization and '-' separation. This is specially designed for big playlists with .mp3 files and have rules like:

- feat. should be all lower case
- All the names should follow this pattern Artist - Music Name feat. Other Artist

## Technologies

For this implementation I'm using NodeJS and the FS library in the backend along with ReactJS to provide the user interface for the web browser.
